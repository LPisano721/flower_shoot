			<p>Jorge McGreenhill has created a mock company called Flower Shoot Incorporated during the pandemic of 2020 after he noticed that people who were in love with one another had nowhere to turn to perform their weddings. Under the federal guidelines, Jorge and his wonderful company not only perform weddings, and create media of the weddings, but now also preside over them.</p>
