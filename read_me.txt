/*		NOTE to reviewer: This project is a mock wedding company. As such, I have
				placed many fun things such as memes, funny pictures, dad jokes,
				easter eggs and other off-color (all SFW) humor in the user side
				of the site as well as in the code itself. Obviously, this has
				no place in a professional enviorment, but, for a school project,
				I thought that it would be safe enough. */
